																						<p>Study Finder app is a iOS & Android Mobile platforms native app designed for college students.
								During the process I researched similar classified apps such as OfferUp and Facebook marketplace. Both apps have inspired me to design for students only.</p>

																														<b>User Testing: Pain Points and Solutions</b>
																													</p>
																													<ul>
																														<li>Allowing non-students to register.</li>
																														<li>
																															<i>As this is a college app, it is meant to give all students, even prospective ones resources in getting to know their campus.</i>
																														</li>
																														<li>Adding some red text in the Study Finder app.</li>
																														<li>
																															<i>Tried adding red text onto the app, however, with it’s dark blue background, it is too bright for the user’s eyes.</i>
																														</li>
																														<li>Adding Icons for the buy and sell category page, to match the home page.</li>
																														<li>
																															<i>Tried putting icons onto the buy and sell page, but they looked too similar to the home page.</i>
																														</li>
																													</ul>
																													<p>
																														<u>
																															<b>Steps:</b>
																														</u>
																													</p>
																													<ul>
																														<li>Decided on a classified app for college app</li>
																														<li>Researched similar apps such as OfferUp and Facebook Market</li>
																														<li>Created user flow for both new and returning users</li>
																														<li>Designed Low Fidelity wireframes</li>
																														<li>Researched apps through iOS and Android mobile platforms</li>
																														<li>Designed Mid Fidelity wireframes</li>
																														<li>Formed ideas for sounds and physical feedback to support interactions for app</li>
																														<li>Creating gestures for user interaction</li>
																														<li>Design final mockups</li>
																													</ul>
																													<br>
																														<p>
																															<u>
																																<b>Mockups:</b>
																															</u>
																														</p>
																														<ul>
																															<li>Purpose: Study Finder is a native app designed for college students. It provides the classified ads within their campuses.</li>
																															<li>Objective: To create an app helping college students find study partners and purchase textbooks.</li>
																															<li>My Role: UX and UI Designer</li>
																															<li>Duration: May 2020 - July 2020</li>
																														</ul>
																														<br>
																															<p>
																																<u>
																																	<b>Conclusion:</b>
																																</u>
																															</p>
																															<p>
																																<i>What went well?</i>
																															</p>
																															<p>Using golden yellow as a complementary color to the dark blue background. The college font logo by itself, already tells you that it is a school related app. I wanted to add the graduation cap and books to give it a more inviting
								look.</p>
																															<p>
																																<i>What didn’t go well?</i>
																															</p>
																															<p>Since the Study Finder app is for college, users felt non-students such as scholarship organizers should have the opportunity to have an account as well. It sounds like a great idea, but the main focus of Study Finder is about
								students connecting within their campus.</p>
																															<p>
																																<i>What could be improved?</i>
																															</p>
																															<ul>
																																<li>After researching to find similar apps to Study Finder, I noticed that there aren’t other college apps that provide the same functions. Since I own an Android, I have limited resources in researching college apps for the IOS.</li>
																																<li>Choosing more than a few colors for my icons. I could add in photos as the categories instead.</li>
																															</ul>

																																	<p>Here is my low fidelity sketch for the Study Finder. This will help narrow down choices for students within their campuses within the classified ads. Although OfferUp and Facebook Marketplace are great ads but they are too broad for
								certain groups (such as distance, and buying items from strangers out of your community too). Having this Study Finder app, it will draw the students closer in discovering around their campus.</p>

																																					<p>I do want to keep the iOS and Android logos behind my wireframes to help differentiate from each other. I was thinking of coloring them into dark blue/gold colors to match my college theme. It was difficult to pick out colors that
								would relate to campuses before making these wireframes into final designs.</p>
